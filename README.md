# React Todo App.
I followed online tutorial to create a Complete Todo Application with all features: 
-build the todo list to add, delete, and modify todo items
-filter and organize each todo item with completion status and priority level

In this todo app, I practice the following:
-have all the CRUD operations
-use React.js and Redux to manage the states
-use Framer Motion to make simple animations

Project Roadmap:
Starter Files Setup
App Title
App Header
Add Modal
Add Todo
Read All Todo items
Delete Todo
Update Modal
Update Todo
Checkbox
Todo Filter
Animation with Framer Motion
Test run and Fixes


## Getting Started

Environment: node 18

After getting the starter files, you need to go the file directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

and after that start the dev server.

```shell
npm start
```

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
