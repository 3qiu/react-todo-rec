# React Todo App
I followed online tutorial to create a Complete Todo Application with all features: 
-build the todo list to add, delete, and modify todo items
-filter and organize each todo item by completion status and priority level

In this todo app, I practice the following:
-CRUD operations
-React.js and Redux to manage the states
-Framer Motion to make simple animations

## Getting Started

Environment: node 18

After getting the starter files, you need to go the file directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

and after that start the dev server.

```shell
npm start
```

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
